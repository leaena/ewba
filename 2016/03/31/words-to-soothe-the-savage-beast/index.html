I have a soft spot especially for Young Adult fiction. I just never grew up I guess. I’ve also always felt that Young Adult books can be more fanciful and expect the readers to suspend disbelief more while still having amazing plot and characters. What it means is that I get to spend time in so many different world.</p>
<p>My routine lately leaves less time for reading, but I’ve made a point to read as much as I can on my 20 minute train ride to and from the city for work. I stick my headphones in and unless I have the perfect playlist for the mood the book gives me (Harry Potter will always be Astrolounge by Smash Mouth for example) I’ll just use that as earplugs to keep me in the book world.</p>
<p>Lately I’ve been reading a lot of delicious scary novels. Books like <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18748653-daughters-unto-devils" target="_blank" rel="external">Daughters Unto Devils</a> that are melancoly and don’t always turn out the way you’d hoped. They’re fun but I needed something a little more fanciful. So I dug through my “To Read” list on Goodreads and decided it was high time I started reading the first book I every added to that list.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10763598-daughter-of-smoke-bone" target="_blank" rel="external">Daughter of Smoke and Bone</a> was… consuming. It was everything I was looking for in a book and brought me back to my childhood of falling in love with the world and heroine likes the ones set before me in Tamora Pierce’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/492490.The_Song_of_the_Lioness_Quartet" target="_blank" rel="external">The Song of the Lioness Quartet</a> and Patricia C Wrede’s <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/86238.The_Enchanted_Forest_Chronicles" target="_blank" rel="external">Enchanted Forest Chronicles</a>.</p>
<p>I can still remember the day I discovered that the single book I’d read over and over and over and over again, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150739.Dealing_with_Dragons" target="_blank" rel="external">Dealing with Dragons</a> was actually a SERIES. I read and read and read and never looked back.</p>
<p>This is what Daughter of Smoke and Bone does to me. It makes me want to read. To devour it all and live and breathe the world so I can be <em>Elsewhere</em> for a time. It also makes me want to re-read my favorite two series (well basically everything in Tamora Pierce’s world not just the Lioness series) all over again.</p>
