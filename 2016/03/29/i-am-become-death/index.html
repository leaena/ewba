But in less than 24 hours my body has sprung forth a vicous cold so death becomes me.</p>
<p>So I promised today that I’d test out some different markdown editors. So that’s why I’m typing the same few sentences over and over and testing out other <em>weirdness</em>.</p>
<p>My main contenders are <a href="http://macdown.uranusjr.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">MacDown</a>, <a href="http://25.io/mou/" target="_blank" rel="external">Mou</a>, and <a href="https://www.typora.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">Typora</a>. So far I’ve been writing in Typora.</p>
<p>But now I’m switching over to MacDown for the heck of it and also checking out Mou for a few words.</p>
<p>So final thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>MacDown and Mou are almost one and the same. I remember use Mou maybe a year ago and MacDown is the new kid on the scene.</li>
<li>Mou feels very sluggish to render the markdown output as you type. Also dat “buy meee” popup that doesn’t have a <strong>cancel</strong> only an <strong>OK</strong>. Especially on a product that was originally supposed to launch in August and we’re now in March.</li>
<li>MacDown was decent. No real drawbacks, but kinda <em>meh</em>.</li>
<li>Typora is something all together different. It doesn’t have the markdown on the left and the output on the right. <strong>It just shows you the output.</strong> It’s kinda refreshing. I could see how some people would hate it, wanting to see their exact syntax all the time, but after I’ve typed out <code>**</code> to bold a thing I don’t mind it just being <strong>bold</strong>. Especially when I can just go back and when my cursor hits the modified text it shows the syntax I used to get there.</li>
</ul>
<p>So &lt;3 to you Typora. I think you’re my new best friend except that my sick brain wants to call you ‘Tyfora’ all the time. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>PS. The Typora word count is a thing to behold as well.</p>
