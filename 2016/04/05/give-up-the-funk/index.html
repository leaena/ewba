To be honest, I’ve been in one for quite awhile, but it’s finally starting to get to me.</p>
<p>The problem is, I don’t really do anything anymore. I go to work, I go home, I watch tv, I go to bed. I go to work, I go home, I go to the grocery store, I go to bed. Weekends aren’t much better. I wake up late, do a couple of chores (vacuum, laundry, whatever) and then I laze around on the internet or reading or petting cats.</p>
<p>I really need to <strong>do</strong> something. I don’t know what to do. Exercise sounds like a decent option but I’m really self concious about going to the gym by myself. I wouldn’t mind taking a class but most of those seem to be geared toward housewives who can make a 11am class no problem (no shade to the housewives, I just generally have to be at work around then).</p>
<p>I could go join something about a hobby of mine, but most of my hobbies lend themselves to solo pursuits or involve video games and I have friends all over the world who are willing to play video games with me.</p>
<p>I need to find something though because this funk is just compounding with everything. Leaving me burnt out and tired and making it even harder to get out of this funk.</p>
