I started a post on time but I was legit not home long enough to write real words yesterday.</em></p>
<p>I’ve discovered 3D movies are not for me. To be fair, I’ve discovered this before. In college some friends and I had the ridiculous idea of watching the truly awful Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser. To this day I mourn Brendan Fraser’s acting career.</p>
<p>At the time we sat around their flatscreen that they probably paid way too much for because this was ten years ago and you didn’t see me and my roommate buying a flatscreen. Walmart TV all the way for us. We even had the old school 3D glasses, cardboard with a red eye and a blue eye that you had to get creative to wear while still keeping your glasses on.</p>
<p>So we were watching just fine. 3D <strong>always</strong> then, and often now, was about the gimmick. So most of the scene was flat and every once in awhile some stupid bird would fly at your face. But the scene that got me, the scene where I  screamed out loud and couldn’t even anymore, was a panorama shot where literally a plant leaf popped into view and scared the crap out of me.</p>
<p>I have never lived that moment down. I probably don’t deserve to ever live that moment down.</p>
<p>I watched Zootopia yesterday in 3D. The 3D was less gimmicky so it didn’t scare the crap out of me. But 10 years have made me older. When I walked out of the theater this time, I just had a giant headache.</p>
